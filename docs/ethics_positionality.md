# Ethics & Positionality

## Land Acknowledgment

This work takes place on Tewa homelands, in a complex colonial city with layered histories of displacement, settlement, and ongoing relationships between Indigenous communities and settler institutions. This acknowledgment must extend beyond words to interrogate how the spatial categories and methods used in this project may reproduce colonial ways of seeing and organizing space.

## Critical Framework

### The Problem of Colonial Categories

The foundational data units of this project—census tracts, parcels, zoning districts—are not neutral containers but active constructions that reproduce particular ways of seeing and organizing space. These categories emerged from and continue to serve systems of private property, racial segregation, and capital accumulation. Working within these categories risks naturalizing the very structures that create inequality.

### From Documentation to Transformation

This project must move beyond documenting inequality to actively supporting:
- **Housing justice:** Not just mapping displacement but resisting it
- **Indigenous sovereignty:** Centering Tewa spatial epistemologies and governance
- **Ecological reciprocity:** Understanding water and land as relatives, not resources

## Ethical Guidelines

### What I Will Avoid

Maps and analyses that:

- Expose specific vulnerable people or locations (e.g., encampments, treatment centers, individual residences)
- Enable surveillance or displacement through "who lives where" mapping
- Sensationalize suffering (addiction, houselessness, crime) without context
- Present data as neutral or objective truth
- Reinforce harmful stereotypes or narratives
- Treat colonial spatial categories as natural or inevitable
- Extract knowledge without reciprocal benefit to affected communities

### What I Will Prioritize

- **Counter-mapping:** Visualizations that challenge dominant narratives about Santa Fe
- **Power analysis:** Making visible the mechanisms of displacement (corporate ownership, STRs, speculation)
- **Context:** Numbers + history + lived experience + structural analysis
- **Care:** Asking "who could be harmed if this map circulates?" AND "who benefits from this analysis?"
- **Partiality:** Acknowledging that maps are partial views, not complete truths
- **Community relevance:** Questions that matter beyond my own curiosity
- **Alternative epistemologies:** Seeking spatial knowledge beyond Western geographic frameworks

## Positionality

*[Add your own reflection here]*

- Who am I in relation to this place? What is my stake in Santa Fe's future?
- What assumptions do I bring from my training in Western geographic methods?
- How do I navigate privilege and power in this work?
- How does my Buddhist practice inform my understanding of interdependence and non-harm?
- What blind spots emerge from my social position?

## Methodological Commitments

### Beyond Extraction

Traditional GIS often extracts data from places and people without reciprocity. This project commits to:
- **Participatory approaches:** Involving affected communities in defining questions and methods
- **Knowledge sharing:** Making findings accessible and actionable for community organizations
- **Contemplative methodologies:** Integrating sustained attention, walking practice, and deep listening
- **Oral histories:** Centering lived experience and community memory

### The Limits of Computation

Acknowledge what quantitative spatial analysis cannot capture:
- The quality of relationships between neighbors
- Sacred geographies and ceremonial landscapes
- Emotional attachments to place
- Networks of mutual aid and care
- Stories held in the land

## Data Ethics

- Question the origins and purposes of data categories themselves
- Consider privacy implications of aggregated data
- Analyze power relations embedded in datasets
- Cite sources and acknowledge limitations
- Be transparent about methods, assumptions, and uncertainties
- Refuse requests for analysis that could enable harm
