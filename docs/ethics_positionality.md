# Ethics & Positionality

## Land Acknowledgment

This work takes place on Tewa homelands, in a complex colonial city with layered histories of displacement, settlement, and ongoing relationships between Indigenous communities and settler institutions.

## Ethical Guidelines

### What I Will Avoid

Maps and analyses that:

- Expose specific vulnerable people or locations (e.g., encampments, treatment centers, individual residences)
- Sensationalize suffering (addiction, houselessness, crime) without context
- Present data as neutral or objective truth
- Reinforce harmful stereotypes or narratives

### What I Will Prioritize

- **Context:** Numbers + history + lived experience
- **Care:** Asking "who could be harmed if this map circulates?"
- **Partiality:** Acknowledging that maps are partial views, not complete truths
- **Community relevance:** Questions that matter beyond my own curiosity

## Positionality

*[Add your own reflection here]*

- Who am I in relation to this place?
- What assumptions do I bring?
- How do I navigate privilege and power in this work?

## Data Ethics

- Use public data responsibly
- Consider privacy implications of aggregated data
- Cite sources and acknowledge limitations
- Be transparent about methods and assumptions
