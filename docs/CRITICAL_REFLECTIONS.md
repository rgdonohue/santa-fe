# Critical Reflections: Ongoing Epistemological Concerns

## The Colonial Grammar of Geographic Data

### The Problem
This project operates primarily through colonial spatial categories—census tracts, parcels, zoning districts. These are not neutral containers but active constructions that emerged from and continue to serve particular power structures:

- **Census tracts** were designed for population surveillance and have roots in redlining
- **Parcels** encode private property regimes imposed on Indigenous common lands
- **Zoning** emerged from racial segregation and class exclusion

### The Challenge
How do we use these categories critically without naturalizing them? How do we make visible their constructed nature while still producing actionable analysis?

### Potential Approaches
1. **Always historicize the categories:** When using census tracts, note their origins and purposes
2. **Seek alternative spatial units:** Watersheds, walking distances, community-defined neighborhoods
3. **Layer Indigenous geographies:** Work with Tewa communities to understand their spatial frameworks
4. **Make the categories strange:** Visualize the absurdity of straight-line property boundaries cutting through ecosystems

## "Who Lives Where" as Potential Surveillance

### The Risk
In a city with profound inequality and ongoing displacement, mapping "who lives where" can become:
- A tool for real estate speculation
- A guide for discriminatory policing
- A resource for gentrification
- A means of identifying "investment opportunities"

### Critical Questions
- Who is asking "who lives where" and why?
- What actions follow from this knowledge?
- How might this mapping enable displacement rather than prevent it?

### Alternative Framings
Instead of "who lives where," consider:
- "Who is being displaced and by what mechanisms?"
- "Where is community resilience strongest?"
- "How are people staying in place despite pressures?"
- "What networks of mutual aid exist?"

## Water as Relation vs. Resource

### Western Geographic Framing
The current project treats water through:
- Proximity (distance to water features)
- Flow (cubic feet per second)
- Risk (flood zones)
- Access (water rights)

### Alternative Epistemologies
Indigenous and Buddhist perspectives might understand water as:
- **Ancestor:** Water that has moved through countless beings
- **Teacher:** Showing us impermanence and interconnection
- **Relative:** Deserving respect and reciprocity, not ownership
- **Sacred:** Holding ceremony and memory

### Implementation Challenges
How do we honor these perspectives in GIS without appropriation or romanticization?

## The Limits of "Small and Honest"

### The Critique
While "small and honest" work has value, it risks:
- Missing systemic connections (Santa Fe's housing crisis connects to global capital flows)
- Providing false modesty that obscures real impact
- Avoiding the bigger questions of structural transformation

### The Deeper Question
Is "honest" mapping possible within colonial frameworks? Or does honesty require acknowledging that the entire enterprise of Western cartography is entangled with domination?

## Technical Attachment vs. Methodological Pluralism

### Current Investment
The project shows deep investment in:
- Python/GeoPandas workflows
- Quantitative analysis
- Reproducible pipelines
- Technical optimization

### What's Missing
- Walking methodologies
- Oral history protocols
- Participatory mapping processes
- Contemplative practices as research method
- Community-based validation

### The Challenge
How do we value technical rigor without fetishizing it? How do we integrate other ways of knowing without treating them as mere supplements to "real" (quantitative) analysis?

## From Harm Reduction to Liberation

### Current Framing
The ethics framework emphasizes "avoiding harm"—a necessary but insufficient standard.

### Toward Transformation
What would it mean to orient toward:
- **Reparation:** How can mapping support land back?
- **Redistribution:** Making visible wealth concentration to support its undoing
- **Resistance:** Creating tools for movements fighting displacement
- **Reimagination:** Visualizing alternative futures beyond current property regimes

## Counter-Mapping Possibilities

### Beyond Documentation
Instead of mapping what is, map:
- **Corporate landlord networks:** Who really owns Santa Fe?
- **Displacement pressure:** Where are people fighting to stay?
- **Sacred/ceremonial landscapes:** With permission, map what matters beyond property
- **Mutual aid networks:** Where does community care happen?
- **Alternative futures:** What would community land trusts look like?

### Technical Implementations
- **Inverse viewsheds:** Map what capital cannot see
- **Desire paths:** Map how people actually move vs. planned routes
- **Temporal layers:** Show displacement over time, not just current state
- **Uncertainty maps:** Visualize what we don't and can't know

## Integration Points

### With Buddhist Practice
- **Meditation on maps:** What arises when we sit with a map?
- **Walking meditation:** Data collection as contemplative practice
- **Non-attachment:** Holding our analyses lightly
- **Right intention:** Constantly examining our motivations

### With Critical Geography
- **Cite Indigenous geographers:** Especially Pueblo scholars
- **Read abolition geography:** Ruth Wilson Gilmore, others on carceral space
- **Study counter-mapping:** Examples from Latin America, Indonesia
- **Engage feminist GIS:** Questions about emotion, embodiment, care

## Questions for Ongoing Reflection

1. How can this project support Tewa sovereignty rather than settler planning?
2. What would it mean to refuse certain analyses that could enable harm?
3. How do we account for what our methods cannot see?
4. Who should have access to what kinds of spatial knowledge?
5. How do we practice reciprocity with the communities we map?
6. What would decolonizing GIS actually require?
7. How do we stay accountable to movements for housing justice?
