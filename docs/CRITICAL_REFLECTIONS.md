# Critical Reflections: Ongoing Epistemological Concerns

## The Colonial Grammar of Geographic Data

### The Problem
This project uses colonial spatial categories—census tracts, parcels, zoning districts. These aren't neutral:

- **Census tracts** were designed for population surveillance and have roots in redlining
- **Parcels** encode private property regimes imposed on Indigenous common lands
- **Zoning** emerged from racial segregation and class exclusion

### The Challenge
How do we use these categories critically without naturalizing them? How do we make visible their constructed nature while still producing actionable analysis?

### Potential Approaches
1. **Always historicize the categories:** When using census tracts, note their origins and purposes
2. **Seek alternative spatial units:** Watersheds, walking distances, community-defined neighborhoods
3. **Layer Indigenous geographies:** Work with Tewa communities to understand their spatial frameworks
4. **Make the categories strange:** Visualize the absurdity of straight-line property boundaries cutting through ecosystems

## "Who Lives Where" as Potential Surveillance

### The Risk
In a city with profound inequality and ongoing displacement, mapping "who lives where" can become:
- A tool for real estate speculation
- A guide for discriminatory policing
- A resource for gentrification
- A means of identifying "investment opportunities"

### Critical Questions
- Who is asking "who lives where" and why?
- What actions follow from this knowledge?
- How might this mapping enable displacement rather than prevent it?

### Alternative Framings
Instead of "who lives where," consider:
- "Who is being displaced and by what mechanisms?"
- "Where is community resilience strongest?"
- "How are people staying in place despite pressures?"
- "What networks of mutual aid exist?"

## Water as Relation vs. Resource

### Western Geographic Framing
The current project treats water through:
- Proximity (distance to water features)
- Flow (cubic feet per second)
- Risk (flood zones)
- Access (water rights)

### Alternative Epistemologies
Indigenous perspectives understand water differently:
- As relative deserving reciprocity, not ownership
- Through specific frameworks like Pueblo Action Alliance's #WaterBack
- Via acequia *repartimiento* (traditional water sharing)

### Implementation Challenges
How do we reference these perspectives without appropriation? Working with/learning from organizations is key.

## The Limits of "Small and Honest"

### The Critique
"Small and honest" work risks:
- Missing systemic connections (Santa Fe's housing crisis connects to global capital)
- False modesty that avoids structural questions
- Limiting scope when broader analysis is needed

### The Deeper Question
Can mapping be "honest" within colonial frameworks? The tension is productive—use the tools while questioning them.

## Technical Attachment vs. Methodological Pluralism

### Current Investment
The project shows deep investment in:
- Python/GeoPandas workflows
- Quantitative analysis
- Reproducible pipelines
- Technical optimization

### What's Missing
- Walking methodologies
- Oral history protocols
- Participatory mapping processes
- Contemplative practices as research method
- Community-based validation

### The Challenge
Balance technical rigor with other methods. Walking, oral history, and participatory mapping aren't supplements—they're equally valid approaches.

## From Harm Reduction to Liberation

### Current Framing
The ethics framework emphasizes "avoiding harm"—a necessary but insufficient standard.

### Toward Transformation
What would it mean to orient toward:
- **Reparation:** How can mapping support land back?
- **Redistribution:** Making visible wealth concentration to support its undoing
- **Resistance:** Creating tools for movements fighting displacement
- **Reimagination:** Visualizing alternative futures beyond current property regimes

### Concrete Examples from Santa Fe
Local initiatives show both possibilities and limits:
- **S3 Housing Initiative** created 122+ units outside market logic
- **Housing Trust CLT** preserves 90 units permanently affordable
- **Living wage** ($15/hr) helps but doesn't address property relations
- These improve lives without fundamental transformation

## Counter-Mapping Possibilities

### Beyond Documentation
Instead of mapping what is, map:
- **Corporate landlord networks:** Who really owns Santa Fe?
- **Displacement pressure:** Where are people fighting to stay?
- **Sacred/ceremonial landscapes:** With permission, map what matters beyond property
- **Mutual aid networks:** Where does community care happen?
- **Alternative futures:** What would community land trusts look like?

### Technical Implementations
- **Inverse viewsheds:** Map what capital cannot see
- **Desire paths:** Map how people actually move vs. planned routes
- **Temporal layers:** Show displacement over time, not just current state
- **Uncertainty maps:** Visualize what we don't and can't know

## Integration Points

### With Buddhist Practice
- **Meditation on maps:** What arises when we sit with a map?
- **Walking meditation:** Data collection as contemplative practice
- **Non-attachment:** Holding our analyses lightly
- **Right intention:** Constantly examining our motivations

### With Critical Geography
- **Cite Indigenous geographers:** Especially Pueblo scholars
- **Read abolition geography:** Ruth Wilson Gilmore, others on carceral space
- **Study counter-mapping:** Examples from Latin America, Indonesia
- **Engage feminist GIS:** Questions about emotion, embodiment, care

## Critical Reading of the Quality of Life Report

### What the Report Celebrates vs. What It Obscures

The QOL report emphasizes collaboration and data-driven solutions:

**Celebrated:**
- Public-private partnerships
- Service delivery metrics
- Nonprofit efficiency
- Grant funding success

**Obscured:**
- Power imbalances within "collaborations"
- Who decides what data matters
- Structural causes of problems being "solved"
- Indigenous sovereignty claims

### The Liberal Reform Trap

The report's initiatives improve lives but also:
- Stabilize rather than transform systems
- May enable continued gentrification
- Create nonprofit dependency on foundation wealth
- Frame Indigenous people as stakeholders rather than sovereigns

### Data as Depoliticization

The "Santa Fe Data Platform" with "1 million data points" suggests objectivity, but:
- Categories remain colonial (census tracts, police districts)
- "Community validation" happens within preset frameworks
- Quantification displaces political questions
- Success metrics avoid questioning property relations

## Learning from Community Organizations

### Chainbreaker Collective's Praxis
Chainbreaker (700 members) demonstrates how to combine direct service (eviction hotline: 505-577-5481) with structural analysis. Their Hopewell-Mann Stabilization Plan shows community planning as alternative to developer-led gentrification. Their research with Human Impact Partners produces rigorous displacement data while maintaining accountability to affected residents.

### Indigenous Sovereignty Frameworks
- **Tewa Women United's** *wi don gi mu* ("we are one") connects individual healing to land healing
- **Pueblo Action Alliance's** #WaterBack campaign reframes water rights as spiritual/cultural reciprocity
- **Three Sisters Collective** creates Indigenous women/femme space outside colonial gender binaries

### Acequia Governance as Counter-Model
NMAA's Congreso de Las Acequias demonstrates non-state governance through traditional *repartimiento* (water sharing). With $68 million infrastructure need, acequias face material crisis while maintaining commons practices that challenge privatization.

### From Service to Organizing
Organizations like Somos Un Pueblo Unido (3,500+ members) show evolution from service provision to power building. Their worker center addresses immediate wage theft while organizing for systemic change (living wage victory).

## Questions for Ongoing Reflection

1. How can this project support Tewa sovereignty rather than settler planning?
2. What would it mean to refuse certain analyses that could enable harm?
3. How do we account for what our methods cannot see?
4. Who should have access to what kinds of spatial knowledge?
5. How do we practice reciprocity with the communities we map?
6. What would decolonizing GIS actually require?
7. How do we stay accountable to movements for housing justice?
8. **How do we use QOL report data critically without endorsing its framework?**
9. **Can reform initiatives like S3 Housing be stepping stones to transformation?**
10. **How do we honor the real help these programs provide while maintaining radical critique?**
11. **How do we support Chainbreaker's organizing without extracting their knowledge?**
12. **What protocols should govern use of Indigenous spatial data?**
13. **How can mapping support acequia infrastructure needs while preserving governance autonomy?**
