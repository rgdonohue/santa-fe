# Santa Fe's struggle for equitable development: Community power, institutional response, and critical mapping resources

**Santa Fe exemplifies the paradox of the desirable American West city**—world-renowned for art and culture yet increasingly unaffordable to working-class residents who built its character. A robust ecosystem of grassroots organizations, Indigenous-led movements, and nonprofit advocates has emerged to contest displacement while state and local governments experiment with progressive housing and environmental policies. This literature review synthesizes community efforts, policy interventions, and available data sources that could inform critical geographic analysis of power, displacement, and resistance in Santa Fe.

The city's **housing deficit exceeds 5,000 units** with median home prices at **$582,000** as of 2024—double Albuquerque's median. Nearly half of all renters are cost-burdened, while **37% of county workers commute from surrounding areas** unable to afford local housing. Indigenous and Hispano communities face compounding pressures from gentrification, water commodification, and environmental injustice—yet they also lead some of the region's most innovative resistance movements.

## Grassroots movements anchor housing justice and Indigenous sovereignty

**Chainbreaker Collective** has emerged as Santa Fe's most prominent housing justice organization, operating as a 700-member economic and environmental justice collective since the early 2000s. Their mission centers on "expanding access to affordable transportation and sustainable communities for working people," with programs spanning tenant rights education, eviction prevention (accessible via a bilingual hotline at 505-577-5481), and bicycle access through their repair workshop. Chainbreaker's most significant current initiative is the **Hopewell Mann Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (2024-2026)**, a partnership with the City of Santa Fe, MASS Design Group, and Santa Fe Indigenous Center that represents what Executive Director Tomás Rivera calls "one of the most important, progressive things that I've seen happen in Santa Fe in my lifetime."

Chainbreaker's research contributions are equally significant. Their 2016-2021 partnership with Human Impact Partners produced "Equitable Development & Risk of Displacement: Profiles of Four Santa Fe Neighborhoods," which documented a "tale of two cities"—one affluent and Anglo, the other browner, younger, and experiencing significant disinvestment. The Hopewell-Mann neighborhood emerged as particularly vulnerable: **75% renters, median income of $31,576**, and lacking health-protective resources like green space that characterize whiter, tourist-dominated areas.

**Santa Fe Housing Action Coalition** operates as a broad-based policy coalition founded in 2018 around four principles: housing as a right, community responsibility for solutions, affordability defined as consuming no more than 30% of income, and inclusivity across demographics. Their advocacy secured the City's commitment to **$3 million annual dedicated funding** for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund—a major victory enabling leverage of private investment at 3:1 ratios.

Indigenous sovereignty organizations demonstrate particularly vital leadership. **Tewa Women United**, established in 1989 by women from six northern Tewa-speaking Pueblos, operates under the Tewa phrase *wi don gi mu* ("we are one") with a mission of "ending violence against Native women, girls, and our Earth Mother by cultivating a Culture of Peace." Their programs address sexual violence through culturally-based response, reproductive justice through a community doulas program, and environmental justice through challenging uranium contamination legacies from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Co-founder **Kathy Sanchez** has documented population decline and health impacts in Pueblo communities proximate to nuclear facilities.

**Pueblo Action Alliance**, led by Julia Bernal of Sandia Pueblo, centers Indigenous women's leadership in fighting for water rights through their **#WaterBack campaign**. Their Water Back Manifesto argues that "#LandBack without #WaterBack" is incomplete, defining WaterBack as "the capacity to protect and practice Indigenous political, cultural, and spiritual reciprocity with water, land, and place." The Alliance traces its philosophical roots to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, maintaining that "our existence has been viewed as a threat" and positioning current organizing within "a long lineage and history of ancestors who also fought for our existence."

**Three Sisters Collective**, founded in 2017 by Dr. Christina Castro (Taos Pueblo/Jemez Pueblo/Chicana), creates "space for Indigenous women, femmes and families through community-based initiatives, mutual aid efforts, and art-based projects." Their land acknowledgment situates Santa Fe on "unceded ancestral Tewa Land, specifically O'ga P'ogeh (White Shell Water Place)"—language that reframes the city's geography through Indigenous spatial understandings.

## The New Mexico Acequia Association leads water rights protection through cultural preservation

Water governance in Santa Fe cannot be understood without engaging the acequia system—community-managed irrigation networks recognized under New Mexico law as political subdivisions of the state, many dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. The **New Mexico Acequia Association (NMAA)**, established in 1990 and headquartered in Santa Fe, functions as both advocacy organization and governing federation through the **Congreso de Las Acequias**, a statewide body of regional watershed-based delegations.

NMAA's Acequia Governance Program strengthens local water governance, encourages the traditional practice of *repartimiento* (water sharing during drought), and builds capacity to resist water commodification. Their **Sembrando Semillas Program** cultivates next-generation acequia leaders through youth engagement, while the **Escuelita de las Acequias** offers retreat-based popular education "affirming traditional knowledge with skills in organizing, facilitation, storytelling."

The **New Mexico Food and Seed Sovereignty Alliance**, administered by NMAA, brings together Native Pueblo growers with acequia growers to protect heirloom, landrace, and non-GMO seeds—connecting water rights to food sovereignty. Their annual **Owingeh Ta - Pueblos y Semillas** seed ceremony and exchange exemplifies the integration of cultural practice with resource management.

NMAA's 2025 legislative priorities seek to increase the Acequia and Community Ditch Fund from $830,000 to $1.5 million annually and double the Acequia Infrastructure Fund to $5 million—addressing an estimated **$68 million infrastructure need** over coming decades. Academic research supports their advocacy: Fernald et al.'s body of work at New Mexico State University documents acequia ecosystem services including aquifer recharge, water quality protection, and heirloom crop biodiversity conservation.

## Nonprofit housing developers and service organizations build parallel infrastructure

The **Santa Fe Community Housing Trust** (now operating as The Housing Trust), established in 1991, pioneered community land trust principles in Northern New Mexico, developing over **700 affordable homes across 24 neighborhoods** while maintaining a 90-unit scattered-site community land trust. Their model separates land ownership from home ownership to preserve long-term affordability—a structure increasingly relevant as market pressures intensify.

**Homewise**, founded in 1986 as Neighborhood Housing Services of Santa Fe, has grown into a certified Community Development Financial Institution with 120 employees. Their recent developments include El Camino Crossing (40 single-family homes plus 13 condos), Miraflores (56 homes), and major involvement in Tierra Contenta Phase III (up to 1,500 homes, 40% affordable). Homewise's 2022 report "Housing Justice = Climate Justice" by Kelly O'Donnell documented that **78% of in-commuters travel alone by car**, connecting housing unaffordability directly to regional emissions.

**Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity** has built 133+ homes since 1987, notable for their Net-Zero, all-electric construction with solar panels—demonstrating that deep affordability (targeting households at 30-50% AMI) and environmental sustainability can be achieved simultaneously.

Food security infrastructure anchors through **The Food Depot**, Northern New Mexico's regional food bank, which has distributed **28.3+ million pounds of food** since 2000. Their Food 4 Kids program provides backpacks to 1,600+ students across 13 Santa Fe elementary schools. **Bienvenidos Outreach**, a 2024 Santa Fe Community Foundation "Tried & True" Piñon Award recipient, serves 200+ households weekly with grocery distribution, with one-third of recipients being children under 17.

Immigrant communities are served by **Somos Un Pueblo Unido**, founded in 1995 by women concerned about California's Proposition 187. Now a statewide organization with 3,500+ members, Somos operates New Mexico's first and only worker center addressing wage theft and labor rights. Their victories include helping establish Santa Fe's living wage (one of the nation's highest citywide minimum wages) and preventing hundreds of deportations through jail policies ending ICE collaboration in five counties.

## Government programs demonstrate progressive ambition amid persistent gaps

**City of Santa Fe's Affordable Housing Trust Fund**, established by ordinance in 2007, represents one of the region's most innovative local funding mechanisms. With **$3.8 million available in FY2024** and a 3:1 leverage requirement (every public dollar requires $3 private investment), the fund has generated significant housing investment: **$27 million+ leveraged from nearly $9 million invested** over three years, impacting 2,500+ households.

The **Santa Fe Homes Program** implements inclusionary zoning requiring 20% of new homeownership developments and 15% of rental developments be affordable for households at or below 80% AMI. The 2025 "Creating Affordability Now" land use code update offers density bonuses of 1.5-2x for developments exceeding 30% affordable units—an incentive approach complementing regulatory mandates.

Santa Fe's **Living Wage Ordinance**, effective since 2008 and reaching **$15.00/hour in 2025**, includes annual CPI adjustments and notably does not create a separate tipped worker wage when employees receive $100+/month in tips. This worker-protective structure traces to advocacy by Somos Un Pueblo Unido and allied organizations.

The **Sustainable Santa Fe 25-Year Plan** (2018) establishes a **2040 carbon neutrality goal** through 91 strategies addressing social equity alongside environmental objectives. The Santa Fe Clean Energy Fund (launched 2023 with $500,000) provides financial assistance for solar installation to income-qualified households—explicitly addressing clean energy access barriers facing low-income communities.

At the state level, the **New Mexico Housing Trust Fund** was significantly enhanced in 2022 when SB 134 dedicated 2.5% of annual severance tax bond capacity, creating an estimated **$20-25 million annual funding stream**. Housing New Mexico (the Mortgage Finance Authority) administers 40+ programs including FirstHome, FirstDown, and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits that directly impact Santa Fe's affordable housing supply.

## Academic research documents interconnected crises and community responses

The most rigorous displacement research for Santa Fe comes from the **Human Impact Partners-Chainbreaker collaboration**, which produced the three-part series "Evictions in the COVID-19 Era" (2020-2021). Key findings include that **96% of low-income renter households experience rent burden**, with 85% of renters earning under $50,000/year paying unaffordable housing costs. The research identified Airport Road and Hopewell-Mann corridors as experiencing disproportionate housing insecurity.

Water scarcity research centers on the **2015 Bureau of Reclamation Santa Fe Basin Study**, which projected potential water shortages of **3,000-15,000 acre-feet/year by 2070** under climate change scenarios. The study modeled climate impacts on Santa Fe River yield and San Juan-Chama Project evaporative losses, evaluating adaptation portfolios including conservation, aquifer storage/recovery, and water reuse.

Legal scholarship on water governance is anchored by the **UNM Utton Transboundary Resources Center**, whose "Water Matters!" publications analyze both acequia systems and American Indian water rights. Eric Perramond's research documents that over 50% of New Mexico has adjudications in progress with only 20% adjudicated—creating legal fragmentation with significant consequences for relationships between water users.

Indigenous water rights settlements provide crucial precedent. The **Aamodt Settlement** (final decree 2017), the oldest federal court case in U.S. history (filed 1966), quantified Pueblo water rights in the Pojoaque Basin and authorized the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System. The 2023 **Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo Settlement** secured $818.3 million in federal funding for water infrastructure and $98.5 million in state funds for acequia improvements—demonstrating negotiated settlement as alternative to adversarial litigation.

## Environmental justice organizations connect ecological and social struggles

**Earth Care New Mexico** (Santa Fe) has emerged as a critical voice for communities on Santa Fe's Southside (Airport Road corridor), neighborhoods surrounded by industrial-zoned land. Their 2019 campaign organized nearly 100 residents against Associated Asphalt & Materials Co.'s air quality permit, filing civil rights complaints against NMED due to language barriers at public hearings. Their Santa Fe Mutualista program provides resource-sharing for resilience, while YUCCA (Youth United for Climate Crisis Action) builds youth leadership.

The **New Mexico Environmental Law Center**, founded in 1987 and based in Santa Fe, provides the region's only nonprofit legal representation specializing in environmental justice. Their client base consists predominantly of communities of color, tribal members, and low-income communities. Current work includes representing Earth Care in civil rights complaints and fighting groundwater pumping proposals threatening regional aquifers.

Water advocacy organizations form a robust network. **Amigos Bravos** (Taos, founded 1988) has designated **700+ miles of rivers and streams as Outstanding National Resource Waters**, protected 29 lakes and approximately 6,000 acres of wetlands, and restored the Red River after mine closure. Their **Water Sentinels citizen science program** (since 2006) provides community-based water quality monitoring. **WildEarth Guardians** (Santa Fe headquarters, 200,000+ members) leads Rio Grande protection through their Wild Rivers Program, advocating for the $15 million Strategic Water Reserve and documenting projected flow reductions of 25-50% by 2100.

The **Communities for Clean Water Coalition** (Amigos Bravos, Honor Our Pueblo Existence, NMAA, Tewa Women United, and others) focuses on Los Alamos National Laboratory contamination, achieving a December 2024 EPA designation requiring NPDES permits for LANL stormwater—a significant regulatory victory.

**Santa Fe Conservation Trust** (founded 1993) has protected **46,000+ acres** through 111 conservation easements while creating 75+ miles of trails including Dale Ball Trails, Atalaya Trail, and the Santa Fe Rail Trail. Their Dark Skies Program, Vámonos community walks, and Passport to Trails field trips demonstrate integration of conservation with community access and environmental education.

## GIS data sources enable critical geographic analysis

### Housing justice and displacement metrics
The **Princeton Eviction Lab** provides the foundational eviction dataset with 80+ million national records downloadable at census block group level. For Santa Fe-specific analysis, the **Human Impact Partners neighborhood profiles** offer census tract-level displacement risk assessments for Hopewell-Mann, Airport Road, Canyon Road, and Downtown areas—the most granular community-generated displacement data available.

The **Federal Housing Finance Agency House Price Index** for Santa Fe MSA (available via FRED) tracks price escalation driving displacement, while the **City of Santa Fe Residential Pipeline Map** monitors development pressure. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund publishes allocations and leverage ratios, enabling analysis of public investment patterns.

### Indigenous spatial data with appropriate protocols
The **Bureau of Indian Affairs Geospatial Support** provides the BIA Tract Viewer mapping tribal, allotted, and jointly managed tracts through ArcGIS Online. The **NM Department of Health** publishes refined tribal boundaries derived from Census TIGER shapefiles. However, researchers must recognize that publicly available data on sacred sites is intentionally limited to protect Indigenous cultural sovereignty—engagement directly with tribal governments is essential for any analysis involving sensitive spatial information.

### Water systems and traditional governance
The **NM Office of State Engineer Acequia Mapping Project** (2017-2019 collaboration with DHSEM and EDAC) provides comprehensive statewide acequia linework—a critical resource for counter-mapping traditional water governance systems. The **New Mexico Water Data Catalog** offers infrastructure data including dams, reservoirs, and pipelines, while OSE's Points of Diversion data enables water rights analysis.

### Environmental justice indicators
**EPA EJScreen** combines environmental indicators (air quality, proximity to hazardous waste, lead paint risk) with demographic indicators (income, minority population, linguistic isolation) at census block group resolution—essential for identifying cumulative burden and environmental racism patterns. The **Santa Fe Basin Climate Vulnerability Study** from Bureau of Reclamation provides climate projection data for water security analysis, while **ClimateCheck** offers census tract-level risk indicators showing that 79% of Santa Fe buildings face wildfire risk and 55 of 69 census tracts have high fire risk.

### Alternative economies and community power
The **Schumacher Center CLT Directory** inventories New Mexico community land trusts with governance details. Community garden networks (10+ in Santa Fe proper, documented through Home Grown New Mexico) map food sovereignty infrastructure. The **Santa Fe CONNECT Network** referral data could reveal spatial patterns in service access and gaps.

## Critical data gaps require community-driven solutions

Several significant data gaps limit current analysis capacity:

- **Real-time eviction tracking**: No ongoing local eviction monitoring system exists; Princeton tracks statewide only
- **Comprehensive rent data**: No systematic rent tracking or rent burden database at census tract level
- **Short-term rental impacts**: No systematic documentation of Airbnb/VRBO effects on housing supply
- **Oral histories with spatial components**: Limited digitized collections connecting memory to place
- **Mobile home park inventories**: Communities at high displacement risk remain poorly documented spatially
- **Beneficial ownership data**: No comprehensive database mapping landlord ownership patterns

Recommended counter-mapping priorities include community asset mapping in Hopewell-Mann and Airport Road corridors, participatory rent tracking through community surveys, oral history geolocation partnering with historical societies, and beneficial ownership mapping of rental properties.

## Conclusion: Toward equitable geographic analysis

Santa Fe's community organizations demonstrate that displacement is not inevitable and that alternatives to extractive development exist. The Chainbreaker-led Hopewell Mann Neighborhood Stabilization Plan, NMAA's acequia governance framework, and Indigenous movements' #WaterBack and #LandBack campaigns offer models of community-controlled spatial practice that challenge dominant planning paradigms.

For GIS practitioners seeking to support equitable development, this review identifies primary sources that center community knowledge: Chainbreaker's displacement profiles, acequia mapping that documents traditional governance, and participatory planning processes generating community-driven spatial data. Critical geographic analysis in Santa Fe must engage not only official datasets but counter-mapping efforts that reveal "what is real and what matters" from the perspective of those experiencing displacement.

The data ecosystem documented here—spanning government portals, academic research, community-generated analysis, and environmental justice indicators—provides foundation for mapping power relations, documenting resistance, and supporting more equitable planning practice. Researchers should prioritize partnerships with community organizations like Chainbreaker, Pueblo Action Alliance, and NMAA who are simultaneously producing knowledge and organizing for change.
